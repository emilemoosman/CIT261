	<h3> Using Ajax (& Local Storage)</h3>
	AJAX stands for <b>A</b>synchronous <b>J</b>avaScript <b>A</b>nd <b>X</b>ML. AJAX is not a programming language, but a combination of existing technologies:<br><br>
	<li>A browser built-in <b>XMLHttpRequest object</b> (to request data from a web server)</li>
	<li>JavaScript and HTML DOM (to display or use the data)</li><br>
	AJAX applications use XML to transport data, but it is also equally common to transport data as plain text or JSON text, hence why the name AJAX can be misleading.<br><br>
	The great advantage of using AJAX is that it allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging data with a web server behind the scenes. This means that 
	it is possible to update parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page.
	
	<p>
		To demonstrate my use of AJAX, I will request the weather data of a city based on user input, from https://openweathermap.org via the open weather API, and display
		an appropriate message.
	</p>
	<p>
		What city would you like to find the current weather for?
		<input id="cityID" placeholder="Enter city">
	</p>
		<button type="button" onclick="cityWeather()">Display Weather</button><br>
		<div id="displayDiv"></div><br>
