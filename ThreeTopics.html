	and Animation and Transition Events</h1>
	
	<h2>Standard Events</h2>
	<p>Below infomation taken from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_events.asp">w3schools</a>.</p>
	<p>HTML events are "things" that happen to HTML elements. When JavaScript is used in HTML pages, 
	JavaScript can "react" on these events. An HTML event can be something the browser does, or 
	something a user does. Often, when events happen, you may want to do something. JavaScript lets 
	you execute code when events are detected. HTML allows event handler attributes, with JavaScript 
	code, to be added to HTML elements. Below are some examples</p>
	
	<h3>Click - The user clicks an HTML element</h3>
	<button type="button" id="clickMe">Click Me</button><br>
	<div id="displayClick" class="hide">"You clicked the button, well done!"</div>
	
	<h3>Mouse Over - The user moves the mouse over an HTML element<br>
	Mouse Out - The user moves the mouse away from an HTML element</h3>
	<div id="mouseMe">Mouse Over & Out</div>
	
	<h2>Mobile Events</h2>
	<p>Below infomation taken from <a href="https://flaviocopes.com/touch-events/">flaviocopes.com</a>, and
	<a href="http://tutorials.jenkov.com/responsive-mobile-friendly-web-design/touch-events-in-javascript.html">tutorials.jenkov.com</a>.</p>
	<p>Touch events are those events that are triggered when viewing the page on a mobile device, like a 
	smartphone or a tablet. Touch events are somewhat more complex than mouse events. Like with a mouse you 
	can listen for touch down, touch move, touch end etc. but a user only has one mouse pointer, whereas a 
	user may touch the screen with multiple fingers at the same time. Touch events allow you to track
	multitouch events. Handling touch events in JavaScript is done by adding touch event listeners. This is 
	done similarly to adding a click listener. You can listen for the following touch events:</p>
	
	<table>
		<tr>
			<th>Event</th>
			<th>Description</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>touchstart</td>
			<td>Fired when the user puts one or more fingers on the screen.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>touchmove</td>
			<td>Fired while the user moves the finger(s) over the screen while touching it.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>touchend</td>
			<td>Fired when the user stops touching the screen.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>touchleave</td>
			<td>Fired when the user moves their fingers outside of the area listening for touch events.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>touchcancel</td>
			<td>Fired when a touch gesture is canceled, for instance if the user moves her fingers outside 
			of the screen itself.</td>
		</tr>
	</table>

	<h1>HTML5 Tags - Video, Audio, and Canvas</h1>
	
	<h2>Video</h2>
	
	<p>Below infomation taken from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_video.asp">w3schools</a>.</p>
	<p>Before HTML5, a video could only be played in a browser with a plug-in (like flash). The 
	HTML5 &ltvideo&gt element specifies a standard way to embed a video in a web page. Associated with the video tag
	is the &ltsource&gt element. The &ltsource&gt element allows you to specify alternative video files which the browser 
	may choose from. The browser will use the first recognized format. The text between the &ltvideo&gt and &lt/video&gt 
	tags will only be displayed in browsers that do not support the &ltvideo&gt element. The video file formats
	supported by the &ltvideo&gt tag are MP4, WebM, and Ogg.</p>
